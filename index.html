  <p>Hi baby. 🥺💕<br>
  Can you believe it’s been 10 whole months? Every single day with you has been like living inside a dream I never want to wake up from. You’re not just my girlfriend — you’re my Shona, my Jaanu, my sunshine, my kitten, my heart’s favorite person.</p>

  <p>You make my world softer, sweeter, and so much brighter. Whether you’re being cute, silly, sleepy, or dramatic (which you are and I love it 😘), you make my heart feel so full. I fall in love with you a little more every day.</p>

  <p>Shona, you have the kindest heart and the prettiest smile. You say things that make my whole day better, even when you don’t realize it. Just hearing your voice can turn the worst day into the best one.</

  <p> I love you so so so so so much so deep, so pure, and our love is so real. You’ve taught me patience, softness, and how beautiful love can be when it's honest and gentle.</p>

  <p>These 10 months haven’t just been a relationship. They’ve been a journey. A love story with giggles, late-night chats, random “I love yous,” and dreams we whisper to each other under the stars.</p>

  <p>You’re not just my girl. You’re my best friend. My calm place. My future. I see you in everything beautiful now. Songs, sunsets, flowers — they all remind me of you, Shona.</

  <p>Thank you, Jaanu, for choosing me. For trusting me. For letting me love you. I promise I’ll never stop. You’ve changed my life just by being in it.</p>

  <p>Even if I wrote a million words, I couldn’t express how much you mean to me. But here’s a start. This little website is my love letter to you, wrapped in code and cuddles :p . 💌</p>

  <p>I hope you are my little girl forever 💍</p>

  <p>I love you more than anything in the whole wide universe. Happy 10 months anniversary, my Shona. You are my everything. 💕</p>

    With all my love,<br>
